# chat-p2p
A basic implementation of a TCP chat app in rust. It utilizes the mio library to handle non-blocking TCP events. This is my first time in developing a TCP application so its essentially me just hacking together some code which is proobably poor practice. Nothneless its a work in progress and a humbling learning experience in regards to learning TCP, P2P, non-blocking IO and multitthreading!
